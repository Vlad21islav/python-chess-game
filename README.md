<h1 align="center">A chess game</h1>
<p>We are doing a project in which we have to write a chess game in python.</p>

<h2>Plan</h2>
<h3>First, we need to learn pygame to visualize our game.</h3>

<h4>We will make some tasks to learn pygame faster.</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Create a square that will always be three times smaller than the height of the window and will always move from right to left.</li>
    <li>make this square a picture</li>
</ol>

<h4>Usefull links</h4>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://younglinux.info/pygame/draw">Pygame draw</a></li>
</ul>
